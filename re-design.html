                    <p>Data and information are the fuel of the internet age, but processes for harnessing the value of data remain underdeveloped. With DataUnion.app, they are giving the influence and profit of data back to the people who make it. Ocean
                        Protocol, which was founded in 2017 by Data Union, is a platform that aims to solve this problem by monetizing data as a financial asset. The Ocean Protocol model is predicated on the tokenization of data. On Ocean Protocol, datasets
                        and data services are tokenized into ERC-20 assets that exist on the Ethereum blockchain. Data providers can sell data access to interested parties while benefiting from the enhanced security and provenance benefits provided by
                        blockchain technology.</p>

                            <span>
                                Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple first appeared
                                in Vietnam in 2009, and they quickly established themselves as a viable
                                alternative to cold hard cash. It is estimated that over 5.9 million people,
                                6.1% of Vietnam’s total population, currently own cryptocurrency (TrippleA,
                                n.d.). Vietnam ranks second in terms of cryptocurrency use, driven by remittance
                                payments, according to a recent survey by a global provider of market and
                                consumer data Statista. Statista’s survey findings showed that 21 percent of
                                respondents in Vietnam said that they used or owned cryptocurrency (Nguyen,
                                2021). However, cryptocurrency is not accepted as a legal form of payment in
                                Vietnam. The State Bank of Vietnam has issued a warning that buying, selling,
                                and using cryptocurrency is risky and not protected by laws.

                                Cryptocurrency exchanges are one of the popular methods to earn Bitcoin in
                                Vietnam (Bitrawr, n.d.). In Vietnam, there are numerous exchanges that sell
                                Bitcoin, and you can simply choose one that meets your needs such as Binance,
                                Bitcoin Vietnam, etc. In additionally, after doing a lot of research I found
                                that there is no Vietnamese platform offers user reward as crypto by uploading
                                images or data like Data Union. There are also no articles mentioning the
                                popularity among young Vietnamese of earning cryptocurrency by annotate photos
                                or sharing data.

                        <p>I will use two research methods Interviewing and Usability Testing to gather data for my research. The location for the tests will all be online due to the pandemic. For Interviewing, I do it over Zoom or Google Meeting, I will
                            ask only open-ended questions like my research questions e.g In what way do young Vietnamese earn ctypto? and observe their reaction. Three interviews might provide enough pain points to indicate a focus for the product. The
                            number of similar outcomes will aid in prioritizing these issues. With Usablity Test research method, I will plan beforehand the tasks the participants will perform. During the test, pay attention and note where they got stuck,
                            where they got surprised, where they hesitated, where they asked questions, where they revoked action, where they meant something else, and where they frowned. User testing reveals what new users understand, what they don’t
                            as well as what misleads them. This reasearch method will help me to anwer my third reseach question.

                        <p>
                            My target group is young Vietnamese living in the city between 18 to 29 years old. I chose Vietnamese young people living in the city looking into cryptocurrencies for a way to earn a living as my target group because my client- Data Union is aiming to
                            create the option of Universal Data Income. Especially for countries with low average salaries compared to e.g. Europe. Consequently, a developing country like Vietnam will meet that criterion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The majority of cryptocurrency trading interfaces are in English, making it more difficult for elderly Vietnamese with limited English to use the currency. Younger participants, on the other hand, are usually thought to be more likely to embrace new technology
                            and to be able to get an initial grasp of how to navigate the web in a shorter amount of time. This is why I wanted the participants to be young.
                        </p>
                        <p>I recruited three participants. Their basic information and how they fit my criteria are written below.
                        </p>



                        <p> First participant:
                        </p>
                        <p> Name: Anh</p>
                        <p> Age: 22

                        <p>Contact: gmsc3699@gmail.com</p>
                        <p> Anh is a young Vietnamese living in Ho Chi Minh city which makes her relevant to our criteria for a participant. She dropped out of University to become a cryptocurrency trader in 2019. I messaged her on Facebook and asked if she
                            would participate, and she said yes.</p>

                        <p> Second participant:
                        </p>
                        <p> Name: Hao</p>

                        <p>Contact: dkmyou14@gmail.com</p>
                        <p> Hao is a Vietnamese university student studying in Ho Chi Minh city. He has started investing into cryptocurrencies for a year. I called him to ask for help with this research and he agreed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Third participant:</p>
                        <p> Name: Hien</p>

                        <p>Hien is now working as a construction engineer in Ho Chi Minh city. He just invested into crypto three months ago. I sent him an invitation on Telegram to be a participant in my research, and he said yes.</p>

                        <p> I'll start by having a friendly chat about their lives and days to give them the sense that they can trust me and that they shouldn't be concerned about anything. I'll ask them if we can start this meeting whenever I believe they're
                            ready. When we get started, I'll ask whether it's acceptable if we record our meeting. After that, I'll provide a brief summary of what we'll be doing today. Here are four steps to take to get this information:

                            <br /> In the twenty-first century, data is the new oil, and many corporations have already realized this to their benefit. The Data Union returns data&#39;s power and wealth to the individuals who created it. Contributors
                            become instant shareholders in data unions by using a reward system based on datatokens. The first Data Vault they&#39;ve created is for images. The Ocean Protocol marketplace has it for purchase. Contributors upload them,
                            annotate them, and then verify their contributions. They are given datatokens as an incentive, making them stockholders in the dataset. This combination of mechanics produces an innate desire to make a positive contribution.<br
                            />
                            <br /> <b>Assignment and problem description:</b><br />
                            <br /> The challenge is to create a better Dataunion.app website. User engagement and user-friendliness are still lacking in current website interfaces. I need to solve that problem by helping them in finding a new and exciting
                            way to use their website DataUnion.
                            <br />
                            <br /><b> Target group: </b><br />
                            <br /> My target group is young Vietnamese in the city between the ages of 18 and 29. Because my client, Data Union, is working to develop the option of Universal Data Income, especially for countries with lower average incomes
                            than, example, Europe. As a result, a developing country like Vietnam will be able to satisfy that requirement.<br />
                            <br /> Because the majority of cryptocurrency trading interfaces are in English, making cryptocurrency use more difficult for older Vietnamese with limited English. Younger participants, on the other hand, are considered to
                            be more likely to embrace new technologies and to be able to get a basic understanding of how to navigate the web in much less time.<br />
                            <br /><b> Context of use for the design:</b><br />
                            <br /> The platform that Data Union promotes among students will be adaptive and user-friendly, allowing users to use it in their daily lives without difficulty. From the students&#39; perspective, they must take pictures or
                            upload photos from their phone&#39;s library, and then make description and verify tags after handing it in on Dataunion.app website.<br />
                            <br /> <b>Key insights:</b><br />
                            <br /> Uploading and verify images then receive crypto as rewards are unpopularity in Vietnam so I need to create a professional and credible UI encourages users to use the website.
                            <br /> In addition, creating a community helps the user connect to people have the same interest and then the network of sharing data will be expanded. Moreover, the website should provide &ldquo;Next/Previous/Skip images&rdquo;
                            option in Verify images so users can feel in control. A tutorial explains the purpose of popular features also helps users can take advantage of the website. Furthermore, I&#39;d want to bring out that young Vietnamese will
                            be more likely to use Data Union if they can do so with their friends, participate in exciting tasks, and feel like they&#39;re playing a game.<br />
                            <br /> <b>Vision statement:</b><br />
                            <br /> &ldquo;To make people feel secure and enjoy when they first use the website&rdquo;
                            <br />
                            <br /> To put it another way, as a designer, I aim to create an environment where young Vietnamese people can have fun while staying secure when using Data Union.<br />
                            <br /> UX Factors<br />
                            <br /> &bull; Ease of use is a fundamental concept that explains how simple a thing is to use. &quot;Users must be able to find Verify within 3 seconds after getting access to the interface,&quot; for example. No one wants
                            to spend hours to learn how the website works, and if f I design a user-friendly interface, it will encourage users to fall in love with Dataunion.app and the service it represents.
                            <br />
                            <br /> &bull; Because my users are young and want to make money in an interesting, amusing, and playful way with some challenges and bonuses, the activation factor is ideal for them. Then it can encourage them to engage as
                            much as possible with Data Union.<br />
                            <br /> &bull; Credible is suit my users because those kinds of a platform like Dataunion.app is not popular in Vietnam. My target group has never heard and used the website before so a professional interface, working with no
                            doubt and no errors will gain trust from them.<br />
                            <br /> <b>The design question:</b><br />
                            <br /> HMW create a credible and engaging platform that gains trust from users who never use it before?
                            <br />
                            <br /> Deliverables schedule<br />
                            <br /> On May 21st I will hand in the Research report and Design brief<br /> On June 14th, I&#39;ll meet with a customer to deliver my first prototype of the Data Union website.
                            <br /> The purpose of this meeting is to get feedback from the customer, tutor, and my classmates.
                            <br /> On June 22nd, I will give a presentation in which I will show my project&#39;s ultimate outcome.
                            <br /> On June 23rd, I will submit the Design report.<br /> &nbsp;

                    <p>Step 1: Create HMW&rsquo;s Questions<br />
                        <br /> I&rsquo;ll presentt list of HMW&rsquo;s questions below that help me establish a strategy to identify possible solutions for the problem and create frames that focus on the specific part of the design solution.<br />
                        <br /> List of HMW&rsquo;s Questions:<br />
                        <br /> 1. HMW make Data Union&rsquo;s interface look more engaging to young people?<br /> 2. HMW create a website that is realiable and professional so that young Vietnamese feel secure working with Data Union?<br /> 3. HMW earn
                        the trust of young Vietnamese who have never heard about Data Union?<br /> 4. HMW make the process of doing challenges more enjoyable than it is now?<br /> 5. HMW make the platform feel more like a community where you can connect
                        with people who share your interests?<br />
                        <br /> Step 2: Coming up with ideas<br />
                        <br /> I began the creative session by brainstorming for divergent ideas after completing the phase of coming up with a probable HMW&#39;s question.<br /> Brainstorming is often touted as a great technique that UX designers can
                        use to generate new and unique ideas.<br /> Even outside of a structured session, brainstorming designers feel a lot more comfortable bouncing ideas off one another. Brainstorming introduces new ideas and perspectives, as well
                        as allowing for out-of-the-box thinking.<br />
                        <br /> &nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <img src="./img/Picture1 2.png" alt="">
                    <p>Next, I'd look at other similar websites that have great UX and UI design. As a result, I went on the search for similar interfaces. Looking at them made me feel more creative and motivated than before since I was able to come up with
                        more practical ideas that might be implemented in real life.
                    </p>

                    <p>Step 3: Identify what I am going to re-design and improve<br />
                        <br /> I&#39;d want to identify the parts of the Data Union.app Mantis website I&#39;d like to improve. As a result, it is preferable to make changes to the Home page, Verify images, Statics page, and Tutorial page. A new landing
                        page and a community feature are also included.<br /> Also, I thought it may be a good idea to divide the main page from the challenges. As a result, create two distinct pages for the users.
