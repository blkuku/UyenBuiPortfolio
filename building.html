                        <p>This first assignment is to create a quick paper prototype for a fitness tracker application for small devices, which is a smart phone and a smart watch. The application is at minimum able to:<br /> &bull; Start and stop tracking
                            in response to user&rsquo;s input<br /> &bull; Track the burned calories, traveled distance, and current speed<br /> &bull; Display this information in real-time to the user<br /> &bull; Display tracked data per day/week/month<br

                            includes a history of working out.</p>

                        <p>How the prototypes evaluated<br />
                            <br /> I sent the picture of my prototypes to my classmate Vincent and ask him for feedback. Because I am the one who knows my product best, I also tried my own design by clicking some buttons to visualize how it would work.
                            As a result, I chose to modify the entire design for a better version. That&#39;s how I came up with the final concept.<br />
                            <br /> The findings<br />
                            <br /> &bull; I should make the prototype more organized and clear<br /> &bull; I should include buttons or links to connect to other devices<br /> &bull; The prototypes still lack of basic required features like stop tracking
                            for smartwatch or display information in real-time to the user<br /> &bull; I should add other features<br /> &nbsp;

                        <p>The first screen is the welcome screen, which convey the value of this application “Join us and change your life” to user. By clicking on “Get started” button, the next screen will show up. This is the app's main screen, which
                            has four primary elements as indicated in the picture. On the tracking screen, user can start tracking The user can view all of the statistics being calculated on the phone screen, including their heart rate, how many calories
                            they are burning, their current speed, and the distance they traveled. The user can stop the tracking by clicking the stop button at the bottom. “My Statistics” screen show user all the data recorded in the day, week, month.
                            All information is displayed in real-time to the user. User can return to the home screen by hovering over the home icon on the left top corner. Two brand new features are added, “My profile” and “Connecting device”. On “My
                            profile screen”, user can see track their fitness level, current height and current weight. “Connecting device” shows user device that are used to connect with this application, user can click on “Connect” button to connect
                            two devices together.

                        <p>The watch design is quite simple since they are already linked to the phone. The second screen “Start tracking” is the main screen for the app's tracking feature. By pressing the "start tracking" option, the user may begin tracking
                            statistics like as speed, calories burned, and distance traveled. They may swipe between the three screens to see the information that is being calculated. When the user clicks the start button, it changes into the stop button,
                            which they may swipe to see this screen and stop whenever they choose. They will be able to examine the data collected later in the data analysis since it will be stored. These are the two screens where you may access the app's
                            other features: “Connecting device” and “My profile.” The user may track their fitness level, current height, and current weight on the "My profile" screen. “Connecting device” displays the user device that is connected to
                            this application; the user can disconnect by clicking the “Disconnect” button.

                            In the original version, the sign-up process is designed in an unintuitive way. On the Log in page, the register panel should be prominent. In addition, the word “Join” is not clear, customers have to spend an extra second deciding which one to click
                            on to register. I added a welcome screen for improved wireframe which does not have in the original version. I also added the writing “Best quality service with best screen” to convey the value of this application. It is clearly
                            shows users where to Log in and Sign up.

                            has a separate login page on a different website, when there could be just one simple login that takes you to the right place.<br /> I aimed for a quick one step sign up process for the improved version. Users only needs to
                            fill basic information. I also add a Thank you screen to show how thankful Lotte Cinema is to have user as their customer and an compelling message about membership benefits.<br /> &nbsp;

                        <p>The orginal version does not have waiting screens. Therefore, I added wating screens to spice up the sign up process. I decided to show users benefits of being a Lotte Cinema&rsquo;s member, it helps to bulid customer&rsquo;s loyalty.<br

                            <br /> I tested the prototype with my classmates. I sent them the link to the prototype and let them freely explore it so the mistakes are found easier instead of introducing it myself. At the end of the test,<br /> I asked
                            them what they thought about that sign-up process and what needs to be improved.

                            assets and components developed and integrated. For this assignment I used Figma. An excellent tool for making high-fi prototypes, since it provides users with a very versatile environment in which to build everything they

                        <p>When the user first encountered the app, the welcome screen is a great way to convey the value of Lotte Cinema’s band “Best quality service with the best screen”. If the user hasn’t had a user account yet, they could click on the
                            Signup button to create a new account. The next screen is the signup screen, which user has to fill in their first name, last name, email, and password. By clicking on the check box, they agree with the “Terms and Conditions”.
                            The user could hover over the “Sign up” button to create an account. After creating an account successfully, the “Thank you screen” will show up with a smile icon. The design delivers emotional that gives rise to positive emotions.
                            It shows how grateful Lotte Cinema to have users as its member and convey a message about the advantages of membership.

                            <br /> I tested the high-fidelity protoype with my classmates: Daria, Vincent and Robin. I also watch what they&#39;re doing and how they engage with my prototype during the test. The test is conducted with only one person
                            at a time, and I ask the participant to share the screen with me as they check out the prototype, and I take notes while they do so. After that, I asked them to express their thoughts, as well as what they liked and what they
                            thought might be improved.<br />

                            The test data clearly shows that 1000 percent of users click on the green button because the color is attractive. Their responses all point to the color as the cause of their feelings. As a result, the hypothesis can be considered to be confirmed / true.

                        <p>The Wizard of Oz prototyping requires the creation of a basic model of the finished product, referred to as a prototype. In this week assignment, I will make an interactive application, in which stimulate machine behavior with
                            human controls. The prototype should then be tested remotely. The user's movements will be the fake input in this prototype, and I'll be able to control the applications based on that.

                            <p>Throughout the course, I&#39;ve used a variety of prototype tools to create various types of prototypes.
                                <br />
                                <br /> &bull; In the begining, the goal was to create a Lo-fi Prototype of a fitness tracker for a mobile phone and watch using pencils, pens, and paper. This sort of prototype, in my opinion, is really simple to create,
                                since it is low-cost, low-commitment, and allows you to rapidly visualize and test numerous concepts in a short amount of time. However, I find it difficult to arrange a large number of elements on a single sheet of paper;
                                it becomes too dense or disorganized, etc., and I have to do it again and over again.<br />
                                <br /> &bull; Starting with Wireframes was a good place for me to start. For this, I choose to use the Balsamiq program. As previously stated, I thought the program was really nice, and I would suggest it to anyone who
                                wants to use it and create a wireframe because of its convenience. Making a wireframe for the Hi-fi prototype can assist me in completing the task that I was unable to do with the paper prototype: ordering all of the app&#39;s
                                parts. After that, I decided to work on an interactive high-fidelity prototype with Figma.
                                <br />
                                <br /> &bull; For Exploratory Prototype , I figured out how to make a basic yet effective prototype to use in Usability Hub&#39;s A/B testing and prove my hypothesis about Color topic.
                                <br />
                                <br /> &bull; The Wizard of Oz method seemed strange at first, but after applying it to construct the Exploratory Prototype, I was delighted. Developers utilize role-playing to evaluate how end users will interact with
                                the prototype after it has been developed. This is a useful approach to test a prototype without having to build a complicated product and yet get feedback from users.<br /> &nbsp;
